I was wondering how long before I have to change my password at a client-site. Scripting to the rescue, scroll down to the bottom of [this page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms974598.aspx), copy the code into a `expiration.vbs` file and start it from the commandline using `start expiration.vbs`
