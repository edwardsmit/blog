I had a hard time finding the correct JRE for my Vista 64-bit installation. Apparantly it's not on the [Www.Java.Com](http://www.Java.Com) site, at least I couldn't find it on the downloads page, and don't get me started on the automated detection/installation procedure at that site. I had more luck on the Sun-site, follow the path of downloads, category, Java, Java 2 Platform Standard Edition, Latest Release (in the top blue header part) for some reason it redirects me first to the Java 5 downloads, Java Runtime 6 update X and there on the bottom the 64-bit for Windows AMD.
