Back when my primary dev-environment was Microsoft I would use the open-source tool [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/) for all my Diff/Merge needs. Great tool, good performance, does the job.
Now that I've switched to the Mac I had to find a new visual Diff/Merge tool, and I want it cheap, or better free :)
Searches in the past didn't turn up any satisfying results, but I think I've found the tool to do the job. Sourcegear, a company I knew from the past for their Vault product, which is a compelling replacement of Visual SourceSafe, has been so kind to distribute their Diff/Merge tool as a standalone and **free** cross-platform tool.
Downloaded, used it for comparing and merging FAST indexprofile files (which are plain XML), loving it.
Oh, I'm not affiliated to Sourcegear in any way, just like their Diff/Merge tool on OSX.
