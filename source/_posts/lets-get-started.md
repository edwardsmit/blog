Back from vacation and ready to go. Welcome on my Blog.

This is the first ever public blog I'm running. Not that this is my first blogpost, I used to work for a company where every employee has his own blog and loved sharing information that way.

I work for LogicaCMG in the Netherlands as a Microsoft Consultant and for the past decade I've been building, designing, teaching, presenting and architecting software systems on the Microsoft platform. Starting at VB4 16-bit in 1996&nbsp;up till the .Net framework 3.0 now and I ain't gonna quit very soon :-)
